# Robot Motion Control System

This repository contains the code for the Robot Motion Control System, developed for the FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) competition. The system includes functionality for Omni-wheel movement, Linear motion control, and Drum spinner control.

## Features

- **Omni-wheel Drive**: Control the robot's movement in all directions.
- **Linear Motion Control**: Raise and lower mechanisms smoothly.
- **Drum Spinner Control**: Spin the drum for collecting or launching objects.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robot-motion-control.git
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Import the project into Android Studio.

3. **Setup the FTC SDK**:
   - Make sure to have the appropriate FTC SDK installed and configured.

## Usage

1. **Deploy the code to your robot**:
   - Connect your robot to your development environment and deploy the code.

2. **Control the robot**:
   - Use the gamepad to control various functionalities:
     - **Omni-wheel Drive**: Use the left joystick for movement.
     - **Linear Motion Control**: Use the triggers for raising/lowering.
     - **Drum Spinner Control**: Use the A, B, and X buttons for controlling the spinner.

## Code Structure

- `OmniWheelDrive.java`: Contains the code for controlling the omni-wheel drive system.
- `LinearMotionControl.java`: Handles the linear motion mechanism.
- `DrumSpinnerControl.java`: Manages the drum spinner functionality.
